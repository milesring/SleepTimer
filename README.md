# SleepTimer

![Alt text](/Docs/Screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

I often fall asleep watching something before bed on my laptop.
This usually results in a dead battery in the morning.
After too many incidents, SleepTimer is my proposed solution to the problem.

Note: I wrote this in an afternoon and have only tested it on my systems.
